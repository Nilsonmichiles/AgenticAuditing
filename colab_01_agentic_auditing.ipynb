This approach is based on the concept of [**Agentic Auditing**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4909147), where specialized AI agents are assigned distinct tasks, such as anomaly detection, compliance verification, and approval flow analysis. Each agent operates autonomously but works as part of a team, ensuring that audit processes are thorough and efficient.
